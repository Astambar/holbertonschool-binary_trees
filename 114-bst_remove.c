/**

bst_remove - function that removes a node from a Binary Search Tree
    Where root is a pointer to the root node of the tree where you will remove a node
    And value is the value to remove in the tree
    Once located, the node containing a value equals to value must be removed and freed
    If the node to be deleted has two children, it must be replaced with its first in-order successor (not predecessor)
    Your function must return a pointer to the new root node of the tree after removing the desired value
