/**

    Prototype: int *heap_to_sorted_array(heap_t *heap, size_t *size);
    Where heap is a pointer to the root node of the heap to convert
    And size is an address to store the size of the array
    You can assume size is a valid address
    Since we are using Max Heap, the returned array must be sorted in descending order
